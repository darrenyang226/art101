// Pseudocoding an Everyday task: Eating at the dining hall
  //Walk from current location (likely Rachel Carson res hall) to nearest dining hall (Porter)
  //Get in likely long line to wait for food
  //While in line, open up the student health E-messenger and prepare to show my badge
    //Log in with username and UCSC Gold Password
    //Do the Duo Mobile 2-step authorization
    //Enter my date of birth for authentication
    //If not completed today, do the daily symptom check survey
  //Get to the front of the line
  //Show the cashier my badge and swipe my card
  //Get food and a drink
  //Eat the hopefully tasty food
  //Clean up after yourself
    //Place silverware in its dedicated section
    //Clear plate and glass of anything
    //Put plate and glass on the dirty dishes merry-go-round
  //Leave the dining hall and go to a class/my dorm/wherever I go next.

//Pseudocoding an Computer task: Basic Math Caculator
  //Receive user input
    //Convert to binary code
      //Restore binary code
        //Combine inputs (run calculations)
          //Output the result
