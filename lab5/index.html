    <h2>Challenge</h2>
      <p>This lab had us work on variables in JavaScript for the first time. We made variables for the Make, Model, Color, Year, and Age of Darren's car, and then displayed them using document.writeln.</p>
    <h2>Problems</h2>
      <p>This lab was pretty straight forward. So far there are no problems encountered.</p>
    <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>This is the index.html file that we created. Below is the program execution.</p>
